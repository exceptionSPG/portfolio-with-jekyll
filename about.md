<p>I am Shiva Prasad Gyawali.</p>

<p>

Hi there! I am a passionate DevOps Engineer. I have a deep love for coding and can often be found sipping on a hot cup of coffee while working on my latest project. However, I also believe in the importance of enjoying life outside of the coding world.

One of my favorite things to do is gaze up at the stars late at night. There is something truly magical about staring into the vast expanse above us and contemplating our place in the universe. Additionally, I find great joy in waking up early to hear the birds singing their morning songs. It's a peaceful and refreshing way to start the day.

As a DevOps Engineer, I have experience in managing complex systems and ensuring seamless integration between development and operations teams. I have a keen eye for detail and a drive to continuously improve processes and systems. I take pride in my ability to understand both the technical and business sides of projects, allowing me to deliver solutions that meet all requirements.

When I'm not coding or working on DevOps tasks, you can find me exploring new places, trying new foods, and spending time with loved ones. I believe that a balanced life is key to success and strive to achieve that balance each day.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I look forward to connecting with you and tackling exciting new challenges together.
